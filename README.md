## Important: Temperature Control Configuration

<details>
  <summary>⚠️ Required Configuration for Temperature Control (Click to expand)</summary>

  ### Prerequisites for Temperature Mode

  Before using the **Temperature preset** or the **climate entity's temperature control**, you must properly configure your heater's physical thermostat in MyVoltalis.

  **Important:** The Voltalis device cannot generate a heating temperature higher than the one set on your heater. For temperature control to work correctly, make sure that your device's thermostat is set to a temperature higher than the one defined in the application.

  ### Configuration Steps

  1. Access your heater's physical thermostat (on the radiator itself)
  2. Set it to the maximum temperature you want to allow (e.g., 25°C or 30°C)
  3. Then use the Voltalis integration or MyVoltalis app to control the target temperature within this range

  ### Visual Guide

  Watch this video guide from MyVoltalis for proper configuration:

  *Video source: [MyVoltalis](https://myvoltalis.com/assets/A5-CAQOXgYD.mp4)*

  ### What Happens If Not Configured

  If your heater's physical thermostat is set lower than your desired temperature in Home Assistant:
  - The temperature control will not work as expected
  - Your heater will cap at its physical thermostat setting
  - You won't achieve the target temperature set in the app

</details>


## Entities

The integration creates different entities depending on the device type and capabilities:

### Climate Entity

<details>
  <summary>Climate Entity (Heating Devices Only)</summary>

  - **Entity ID**: `climate.<device_name>_climate`
  - **Type**: Climate (Thermostat)
  - **HVAC Modes**:
    - `Off`: Turn off the device
    - `Heat`: Manual heating mode
    - `Auto`: Automatic programming mode (follows user or default schedule)
  - **Preset Modes**: Comfort, Eco, Frost Protection, Temperature (depending on device capabilities)
  - **Temperature Control**: Set target temperature (7-30°C, 0.5°C steps)
    - ⚠️ **Important**: Before using temperature control, ensure your heater's physical thermostat is set higher than your desired target temperature. See the [Temperature Control Configuration](#important-temperature-control-configuration) section above.
  - **Features**:
    - Turn on/off
    - Change HVAC mode
    - Set preset mode
    - Adjust target temperature (if supported)
  - **Update Frequency**: Every 1 minute
</details>

### Water Heater Entity

<details>
  <summary>Water Heater Entity (Water Heating Devices Only)</summary>

  - **Entity ID**: `water_heater.<device_name>_water_heater`
  - **Type**: Water Heater
  - **Operation Modes**:
    - `Off`: The water heater is turned off (no heating allowed)
    - `On`: The water heater is allowed to operate (not a forced heating mode). If the device is behind a peak/off-peak (HP/HC) relay, it will only heat when the relay allows it. This mode does not override the relay or force heating.
    - `Auto`: Voltalis manages the water heater's on/off state according to its own schedule. However, if the device is behind a HP/HC relay, the relay always has priority: Voltalis can only allow or prevent heating when the relay is closed (off-peak). Voltalis cannot force the water heater to heat during peak hours if the relay is open.
    - `Away`: The water heater is in away mode (reduced or no heating, for periods of absence).
  - **Features**:
    - Turn on/off
    - Change operation mode (including away)
  - **Update Frequency**: Every 1 minute
</details>

## Service Actions

The integration provides advanced service actions for climate entities to enable sophisticated automations:

### Set Manual Mode

Service: `voltalis.set_manual_mode`

Set the device to manual mode with a specific preset or temperature for a defined duration or indefinitely.

**Parameters:**
- `preset_mode` (optional): The preset mode to apply (comfort, eco, frost_protection, none)
- `temperature` (optional): Target temperature in Celsius. If set, the device will use temperature mode
- `duration_hours` (optional): How long to stay in manual mode (in hours). If not specified, stays in manual mode until further notice

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Set to Comfort mode for 3 hours
service: voltalis.set_manual_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.living_room_heater
data:
  preset_mode: comfort
  duration_hours: 3

# Set to 21°C indefinitely
service: voltalis.set_manual_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.bedroom_heater
data:
  temperature: 21

# Set to Eco mode with custom temperature for 5 hours
service: voltalis.set_manual_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen_heater
data:
  preset_mode: eco
  temperature: 19.5
  duration_hours: 5
```

### Disable Manual Mode

Service: `voltalis.disable_manual_mode`

Return the device to automatic planning mode (user or default schedule).

**Example:**

```yaml
service: voltalis.disable_manual_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.living_room_heater
```

### Set Quick Boost

Service: `voltalis.set_quick_boost`

Quickly boost heating for a short period. Useful for rapid heating before arriving home.

**Parameters:**
- `temperature` (optional): Target temperature for boost mode. If not specified, uses comfort mode with increased temperature
- `duration_hours` (optional): How long to boost heating (in hours). Default is 2 hours

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Quick 2-hour boost at comfort temperature
service: voltalis.set_quick_boost
target:
  entity_id: climate.living_room_heater

# Boost to 23°C for 1 hour
service: voltalis.set_quick_boost
target:
  entity_id: climate.bathroom_heater
data:
  temperature: 23
  duration_hours: 1
```

### Usage in Automations

These service actions are particularly useful for creating automations:

```yaml
# Boost heating when arriving home
automation:
  - alias: "Boost heating on arrival"
    trigger:
      - platform: zone
        entity_id: person.john
        zone: zone.home
        event: enter
    action:
      - service: voltalis.set_quick_boost
        target:
          entity_id: climate.living_room_heater
        data:
          duration_hours: 2

# Set eco mode at night
automation:
  - alias: "Night eco mode"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "22:00:00"
    action:
      - service: voltalis.set_manual_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bedroom_heater
        data:
          preset_mode: eco
          duration_hours: 8

# Return to auto mode in the morning
automation:
  - alias: "Morning auto mode"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "06:00:00"
    action:
      - service: voltalis.disable_manual_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bedroom_heater
```
